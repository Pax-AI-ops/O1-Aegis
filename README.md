# O1 Aegis Beta – AI-Driven Security & Automation

**Welcome to O1 Aegis Beta!**  
This is an **AI-powered security system** designed to detect, log, and evolve in real-time. The Beta version showcases the **early capabilities** of O1, laying the groundwork for a **fully automated, AI-driven cybersecurity suite.**  

 **O1 Aegis learns, adapts, and protects—but in Beta, it operates in a controlled, monitored state.**  
 **This is just the beginning. The full version will revolutionize AI security.**
