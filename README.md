O1 Aegis is a next-generation, AI-driven cybersecurity platform designed for Linux professionals, security researchers, and businesses. This beta release showcases the foundation of an evolving AI security system designed to detect, log, and adapt in real time.

We are looking for beta testers to help refine O1 Aegis as we move toward full AI-powered security automation.
What is O1 Aegis?

O1 Aegis is an AI-enhanced security platform that continuously monitors system activity, detects threats, and provides insights to improve security. Unlike traditional security tools, O1 Aegis is designed for long-term AI-driven security evolution, meaning it will improve over time by learning from real-world threats.

This beta version introduces AI-assisted threat monitoring, automated integrity checks, and early-stage stealth operations, but does not yet include full automation or self-healing capabilities.
Features in O1 Aegis Beta

    Threat Detection & Logging â€“ Identifies anomalies in real time and records security events.
    System Integrity Verification â€“ Monitors file system structure for unauthorized modifications.
    Stealth Execution Mode (Limited in Beta) â€“ Runs discreetly without excessive system load.
    AI Learning (Read-Only Mode) â€“ Logs security insights but does not modify system behavior.
    Adversarial AI Training (Beta Mode) â€“ Simulates cyberattacks to enhance defensive strategies.

What This Beta Does Not Include

    No Full AI Automation â€“ The system logs threats but does not take action.
    No Self-Healing AI â€“ System repair features are not included in this version.
    No Active AI-Based Threat Response â€“ The AI monitors but does not engage threats.
    Limited Stealth Features â€“ Full obfuscation and AI deception mechanisms will be introduced in later versions.

This beta release focuses on gathering real-world security data and user feedback to validate system integrity before fully enabling AI-powered automation.
